## Overview

**LeetCode Helper** adds a right-side panel on problem pages that:
- Detects the **current problem** (title, URL, difficulty).
- Parses your **in-editor code** (language, content, runtime/compile messages where available).
- Lets you ask targeted questions like “why does this TLE on case X?” or “is there a simpler loop?”
- Returns **minimal diffs** that preserve your style and variable names, with explicit **time/space complexity** notes.
- Explains solution logic **before** revealing a full implementation (unless you ask for it).

> Users authenticate with **their own** API keys from OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude. Choose your preferred AI model from the settings dropdown.

---

## Key Features

- ✅ **Quick-access sidebar** on LeetCode pages (no tab/context switching).  
- ✅ **Minimal-change recommendations**: keep identifiers & style; propose surgical edits.  
- ✅ **Logic-first coaching**: explain approach & invariants before full solutions.  
- ✅ **Time/space complexity feedback** on your current approach and on suggested tweaks.  
- ✅ **Problem auto-detection & code parsing** (language-aware).  
- ✅ **Multi-provider support**: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4, etc.), Google Gemini (1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash, etc.), and Anthropic Claude (3.5 Sonnet, Opus, etc.)  
- ✅ **Automatic model detection**: Extension tests your API keys and only shows models you have access to
- ✅ **Smart model selection**: Dropdown automatically updates based on your account tier

## Software Product Statement

Our LeetCode extension, available in **8 weeks**, is a browser tool that enhances learning, helping students and coding interview candidates track their LeetCode progress, identify weaknesses, and **offer improvements on their code with minimal intervention**.

---

## User Stories

- **As a student**, I want the chatbot to assist with LeetCode problems **without copy-pasting** code into another tab. It should access what’s in my editor and help debug issues in place.  
- **As an interview-prep student**, I want to understand the solution **step-by-step** without spoiling the full solution unless I ask for it. I want to track **where I’m weak** over time.  
- **As a user**, I want a Chrome extension that **identifies the current problem**, **parses my code**, and lets me **ask where bugs or improvements might be**.

> We aim to **streamline** the process of asking an LLM about your code, **never leaving the LeetCode page**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Content Script** injects a sidebar on `leetcode.com` problem pages.  
2. On load / change, the script **reads problem metadata** and **extracts editor code**.  
3. The sidebar **renders a chat** (React) with our **custom prompts** & safety rails.  
4. When you ask for help, the extension sends a **structured prompt** (problem + code + intent) to the OpenAI API **using your key**.  
5. Responses are **post-processed** to:  
   - Highlight **minimal diffs** (patch blocks).  
   - Annotate **time/space complexity**.  
   - Prioritize **logic explanations** before code.  
6. You can **apply suggestions** manually or copy a patch snippet.

## Configuration

### Set Up Your API Keys and Model

1. **Open Extension Settings**:
   - **Method 1**: Right-click the extension icon → "Options"
   - **Method 2**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` → Click "Details" under LeetCode Assistant → "Extension options"
   - **Method 3**: Click the ⚙️ settings icon in the side panel

2. **Enter Your API Key(s)**:
   You can add one or more API keys from different providers:
   - **OpenAI API Key**: Paste your key (starts with `sk-...`)
   - **Google Gemini API Key**: Paste your key (starts with `AIza...`)
   - **Anthropic Claude API Key**: Paste your key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

3. **Save and Auto-Detect Models**:
   - Click "Save" to test your API keys
   - The extension will automatically detect which models are available for your account
   - This process takes ~10-30 seconds depending on how many providers you use
   - You'll see progress: "Testing OpenAI models...", "Testing Gemini models...", etc.
   - Only minimal API calls (5 tokens each) are used to minimize costs

4. **Select Your Model**:
   - After detection, the dropdown shows **ONLY** models you have access to
   - Choose your preferred model from the dropdown
   - Models vary based on your API tier:
     - **OpenAI**: May show GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo
     - **Google Gemini**: May show Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini Pro
     - **Anthropic Claude**: May show Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku
   - If a model doesn't appear, your API key doesn't have access to it

5. **Security**:
   - All API keys are stored **locally** in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`
   - They're **never sent** to any server except the official API of the provider you selected
   - You can clear them anytime from the options page

---

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Visit a LeetCode problem**:
   - Go to any problem page, e.g., `https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/`

2. **Open the assistant**:
   - Click the extension icon in your toolbar
   - The side panel will open on the right side

3. **Verify problem detection**:
   - You should see the problem name at the top (e.g., "two sum · #1")
   - If not detected, refresh the page

4. **Ask questions**:
   - Type your question in the input box
   - Examples:
     - "Can you give me a hint for this problem?"
     - "What pattern should I use?"
     - "Explain the two pointers approach"
     - "What's the time complexity of a brute force solution?"

5. **Get contextual help**:
   - The AI knows which problem you're on
   - It provides hints before full solutions
   - Explanations include time/space complexity

### Advanced Features

#### Selection-Based Questions

1. **Select text or code** on the LeetCode page
2. Wait for the **"💬 Ask Assistant"** button to appear near your selection
3. Click it to send the selection to the chat
4. The side panel opens automatically with your selection ready to analyze

This is useful for:
- Getting explanations of specific code snippets
- Asking about error messages
- Understanding problem constraints
- Analyzing test cases

#### Resetting the Conversation

- Click the **↩️ Reset** button in the side panel header
- This clears the chat history but keeps the current problem context
- Useful when switching approaches or starting fresh

#### Navigation Handling

- The extension **automatically detects** when you navigate to a new problem
- The chat **auto-resets** when the problem changes
- Problem metadata updates in real-time

## Prompts & Guardrails

### System Prompt Philosophy

The assistant uses a carefully crafted system prompt that emphasizes:

1. **Educational Focus**:
   - Teach problem-solving patterns (two pointers, sliding window, DP, etc.)
   - Encourage understanding over memorization
   - Build algorithmic thinking skills

2. **Hints-First Approach**:
   - Provides **incremental hints** before revealing solutions
   - Uses Socratic questioning: "What if you kept a window invariant?"
   - Escalates only when needed: small hint → bigger hint → outline → full solution

3. **Structured Framework**:
   - Restate the problem clearly
   - Identify constraints and edge cases
   - Design examples (including tricky ones)
   - Start with brute force, then optimize
   - Explain correctness (invariants, proofs)
   - Analyze time/space complexity
   - Provide clean, commented code

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Readable variable names
   - Helper functions for clarity
   - Brief docstrings and inline comments
   - Handles edge cases explicitly

### Guardrails & Safety

The system prompt includes explicit boundaries:

- ❌ **No contest cheating**: Won't solve active contest problems in real-time
- ❌ **No plagiarism**: Encourages understanding, not copy-paste
- ❌ **No guarantees**: Reminds users that practice and judgment are required
- ✅ **Privacy-respecting**: Never requests sensitive personal data
- ✅ **Educational purpose**: Clear that it's a learning tool

### Pattern Categories Covered

The assistant is trained to explain these common patterns:
- Two pointers, sliding window, fast/slow pointers
- Prefix/suffix arrays, monotonic stack
- Heap/priority queue, binary search
- Intervals, graphs (BFS/DFS/Topo), union-find
- Backtracking, dynamic programming (1D/2D/knapsack)
- Trees, tries, segment trees, Fenwick trees
- Bit manipulation, mathematical patterns
