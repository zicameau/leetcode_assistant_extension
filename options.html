      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How does the extension work?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          When you're on a LeetCode problem page, the extension automatically detects the problem details. You can paste your code 
          or describe your issue in the chat interface, and the AI will analyze your code, explain errors, suggest fixes, and help 
          you understand the solution approach. The extension uses your selected AI model (GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude) to provide 
          intelligent, context-aware assistance.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What programming languages are supported?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The extension supports all major programming languages commonly used on LeetCode, including Python, Java, JavaScript, 
          C++, C#, Go, Rust, Swift, and more. The AI models are trained on code across multiple languages and can provide 
          language-specific guidance and best practices.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Does it give me solutions or just debugging help?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The extension is designed to help you learn, not just give answers. It focuses on debugging your existing code, explaining 
          errors, suggesting improvements, and guiding your thinking. While it can provide hints and explain solution approaches, 
          it encourages you to understand the problem-solving process rather than simply copying solutions.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How is my privacy handled?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Your privacy is a top priority. All API keys are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage. Your code 
          and conversations are sent directly to the AI provider you choose (OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic) for processing. When you're 
          signed in, chat history is stored securely. In guest mode, no data is persisted. We never collect, store, or share your 
          personal information or code.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do I need to be signed in to use the extension?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          No! You can use the extension in guest mode without signing in. However, signing in enables additional features like 
          persistent chat history, saving your debugging sessions, and searching through past conversations to find similar problems 
          you've worked on before.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What are the known limitations?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The extension requires an active internet connection and valid API keys for the AI models. Response quality depends on 
          the selected model and your API key's rate limits. Very long code snippets may need to be broken into smaller parts. 
          The extension works best when you're actively on a LeetCode problem page, as it uses the page context to provide more 
          relevant assistance.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">The extension isn't detecting my LeetCode problem. What should I do?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Make sure you're on an active LeetCode problem page (not the homepage or problem list). Try refreshing the page and 
          reopening the extension side panel. If the problem still isn't detected, you can manually describe the problem in your 
          chat message, and the AI will still be able to help you.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">I'm getting API errors. How do I troubleshoot?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          First, verify that your API key is correct and has sufficient credits/quota. Check that you've selected a model that 
          matches your API key (e.g., don't select a Gemini model if you only have an OpenAI key). Try saving your settings again 
          to re-detect available models. If issues persist, check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages. Make sure 
          your API key hasn't expired or been revoked.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I use multiple AI models at the same time?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          You can add API keys for multiple providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) simultaneously, but you'll select one model at a time 
          to use for your conversations. This allows you to switch between models to compare responses or use different models for 
          different types of problems. Just select your preferred model from the dropdown above.
